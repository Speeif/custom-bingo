# custom-bingo
This project was created to generator bingo plates for when watching videos, movies, and series together. The intention is that a group get together, agree on specific fields to include in the randomization of a bingo card, before generating the cards for each player.

Participants found it important to each have their own method of filling out the cards. Either by printing the plate on paper, opening an image of it in a paint program, or finding another alternative. As such the functionality for crossing off squares is only barebone, as this has shown to be the least interesting feature of the project.
